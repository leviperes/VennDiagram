# VennDiagram
A Venn diagram is an illustration that uses overlapping circles to show the logical relation between two or more sets of items. Circles that overlap have a commonality while circles that do not overlap do not share those traits. The Venn diagram was popularized by John Venn in the 1880s.

This Streamlit application will let you create a Venn Diagram by simply pluging in the numbers. The areas representing the sets will be proportional wiht the size of the set.
